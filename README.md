RAVM: compile once and run anywhere https://zsmith.co/ravm.html

 What is RAVM?
RAVM stands for RISC-Approximating Virtual Machine, 
meaning it uses a simplified instruction format to maximize performance. 
RAVM is my nascent write-once, eventually-run-anywhere project. 
The project currently consists of the virtual machine itself, 
which I coded mostly in x86 assembly language, 
and a simple assembler (RASM) that produces bytecode for RAVM to run.
